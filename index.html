    <P>The iPad Pro is a premium professional sub-lineup of the iPad tablet computers by Apple Inc. It runs iPadOS, an optimized derivation from the predecessor iOS. The original iPad Pro, introduced in September 2015, was originally based on iOS 9. The second generation, unveiled in June 2017, made use of an upgraded A10X Fusion chip with an extended 10.5-inch screen display. The home button was eliminated following the third lineup (October 2018) for a full display at 11-inch, and it features an array sensor Face ID capable of performing unlocking at wide angles. The fourth lineup, introduced in March 2020, included the A12Z chip with added compatibility to the Magic Keyboard. The fifth generation was announced in April 2021, incorporating a desktop-class SoC Apple silicon M1 chip, marking the first model to not use an A-series processor. The sixth and current generation, introduced in October 2022, included the M2 chip, Apple Pencil Hover, and ProRes video.</P>

    <p>The first generation of iPad Pro came in two sizes: 12.9-inch and 9.7-inch. The 12.9-inch version was announced on September 9, 2015[12] and released on November 11, 2015.[13] It is larger than all previous iPad models, was the first iPad to feature LPDDR4 RAM,[1] and originally shipped with iOS 9.1. The 9.7-inch iPad Pro was announced on March 21, 2016 and released on March 31 that same year.[14] It was based on the form factor of the iPad Air 2 and originally shipped with iOS 9.3.</p>

<p>The Magic Keyboard features the first trackpad designed for an iPad, a hinge to adjust the viewing angle and includes a USB-C port for pass-through charging.[17] The Magic Keyboard is supported by all iPad Pro devices introduced since 2018. Though initially expected to launch in May 2020, orders shipped starting in late April 2020.[37] The Magic Keyboard was met with mixed reviews. While providing many features which users wanted, there were some downsides to it. The Magic Keyboard provided a proper typing experience and supplied a good trackpad bundled with excellent build quality. On the downside, the added weight to the iPad Pro for this functionality, a missing function key row and a steep price, made the Magic Keyboard an accessory only for a niche market.[38] With the launch of 5th generation of iPad Pro on 20 April 2021, a white color has also been added to the Apple Store.</p>
